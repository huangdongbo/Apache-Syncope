==== Access Managers

_Access Managers_ focus on the application front-end, enforcing application access via authentication
(how users are let access a given system) and authorization (which capabilities each user owns on a given system).

Several practices and standards can be implemented by Access Managers:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on[Single Sign-On^]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication[Multi-Factor Authentication^]
* https://oauth.net/[OAuth^]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language[SAML^]
* https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect^]

[NOTE]
====
Applications can typically integrate with Access Managers by:

* implementing at least one of the most diffuse protocols as OpenID Connect or SAML - also called _native integration_;
* being protected by a security-enabled HTTP reverse proxy, which will in turn interact with Access Managers - also
called _legacy integration_.
